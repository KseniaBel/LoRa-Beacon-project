# LoRaBeacon Project

What is it?
-----------

The LoRaBeacon Project aims to simplify the logistic challenges that come with inventory management within large areas.
By using the LoRa networking technology combined with Bluetooth beacons we can easily locate beacon-tagged objects and
map them.

In order to make it easily accessable on the floor, we developed a mobile website that is easy to use and runs on
every device with a screen and an internet connection.
